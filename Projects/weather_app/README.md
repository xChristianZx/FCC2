This is my weather app

a long freaking journey for this thing trying to implement the API call with the impending CORS problems and such

An interesting set of problems have occurred along the way, including trying to use XHR, jquery AJAX, and axios all along the way

and then trying to use NPM to import the weather-icons package as well as starting to jump into node.js

NOTES:

utilizing openweathermap API, but other considerations were Dark Sky and Weather Underground.
