# **Wikipedia Viewer**

The Wikipedia Viewer for FCC intermediate Projects

User Stories
============
- I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.

- I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.


Notes for self - (Things I have learned)
=====================

- cannot run 'require' method as it is a server-side node/ common js method as opposed to a browser method

- event.preventDefault() - prevents the default action of the element.  See http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/

- fetch() - it's like axios.....

To Do
======

- CSS styling/ transitions / background image (diagonal)

- get query API working
